## Introduction

This dataset is a collection of professional pickleball matches found at pklmart.com. We were able to get 2 main dataframes through the use of the pklshop API. One dataframe contained information about 2500+ rallies across different 50 different pickleball matches. The next dataframe contained information about 22,000 shots from these rallies. We combined the results of these two dataframes into a final dataframe.

### Point Analysis

Through the use of this dataframe, we hope to be able to predict the winner of an individual pickleball point through machine learning models based on metrics found in these datasets. 

After we have created a model, we will analyze the classifiers that made up this model, and attempt to identify the most important features of what makes a winning point for each team.
